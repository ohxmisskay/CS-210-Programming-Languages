* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project was to create a menu screen based on the client's requested criteria. The objective was to develop a program to make a file with the sorted frequency grocery list and have a menu option to select one item for frequency data, all things for frequency data, all items for frequency data converted into a histogram, and exiting the program. The problem that was being solved was to allow the company to analyze records of the recorded items to make a practical layout for their customers.

* What did you do particularly well?

The section I felt confident I executed was structuring the program's layout. When reading the directions, I break down the program by the functions needed to complete the tasks. From there, I will test the code for every written segment until it meets satisfaction. If I cannot execute the code, I will return to the readings or research how to manage the program correctly.

* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Improvements I can make to enhance my code are to be more precise when leaving comments and to always include input validation. I need to improve my in-line comments, especially with including user prompts. Also, I become so engulfed in executing the codes that testing for all "wrong" answers bypasses my mind. 

* Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging code to write was how to execute the input validation properly. The section I struggled with was when the user inputted symbols instead of numbers, causing the output to overflow, resulting in the code crashing. I overcame this because my professor uploaded a help section for the validation on youtube. 

* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Skills transferable to other projects and coursework would be utilizing classes and maps. Classes are beneficial because it helps to make it manageable when working with objects. When classes use inheritance and other OOPs skills, it makes it easier to reuse codes for future projects. Maps help when creating indexes/references regardless of the data size.

* How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Making the program more maintainable, readable, and adaptable can be resolved by avoiding repetition in code, consistent formatting & indentation, and adding detailed comments. Repetition in writing makes the code difficult to read and the program lengthy, and keeping consistent formating makes it easier to read and reduces the chances of mistakes. Lastly, adding detailed comments can explain how and why the program needs certain functions.
